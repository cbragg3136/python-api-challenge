Part I - WeatherPy

Three observable trends:

1) When comparing the max temperature (F) on 10/11/2020 relative to the latitudes of the cities within the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere, the nothern hemisphere cities have a strong negative correlation with temperatures decreasing the farther away from the equator, while there is a positive correlation for the cities in the southern hemisphere indicate the temperatures also increase closer to the equator. The temperatures are not as cool at the southern most city relative to the nothern. Outliers were removed and there are fewer number of data points in the southern hemisphere, likely skewing the results.

2) Cloudiness and humidity showed a slight positive to no correlation along increasing latitudes in both hemispheres.  Most of the cities had a humidity level greater than 70 across the dataset on 10/11/2020.

3) Wind speed showed a slight positive to no correlation in the direction of both poles. Most of the cities had a wind speed less than 5mph across the dataseton 10/11/2020.
